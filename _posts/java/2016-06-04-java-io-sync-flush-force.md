Hdfs的block怎么样确写入磁盘呢？如果要是我自己去做，肯定是 flush,然后sync。

Hdfs的实现是通过Channel的 force实现的，然后具体了解了一下flush,sync,force的实现机制。


## force

force是FileChannel的一个方法

    /**
     * Forces any updates to this channel's file to be written to the storage
     * device that contains it.
     *
     * <p> If this channel's file resides on a local storage device then when
     * this method returns it is guaranteed that all changes made to the file
     * since this channel was created, or since this method was last invoked,
     * will have been written to that device.  This is useful for ensuring that
     * critical information is not lost in the event of a system crash.
     *
     * <p> If the file does not reside on a local device then no such guarantee
     * is made.
     *
     * <p> The <tt>metaData</tt> parameter can be used to limit the number of
     * I/O operations that this method is required to perform.  Passing
     * <tt>false</tt> for this parameter indicates that only updates to the
     * file's content need be written to storage; passing <tt>true</tt>
     * indicates that updates to both the file's content and metadata must be
     * written, which generally requires at least one more I/O operation.
     * Whether this parameter actually has any effect is dependent upon the
     * underlying operating system and is therefore unspecified.
     *
     * <p> Invoking this method may cause an I/O operation to occur even if the
     * channel was only opened for reading.  Some operating systems, for
     * example, maintain a last-access time as part of a file's metadata, and
     * this time is updated whenever the file is read.  Whether or not this is
     * actually done is system-dependent and is therefore unspecified.
     *
     * <p> This method is only guaranteed to force changes that were made to
     * this channel's file via the methods defined in this class.  It may or
     * may not force changes that were made by modifying the content of a
     * {@link MappedByteBuffer <i>mapped byte buffer</i>} obtained by
     * invoking the {@link #map map} method.  Invoking the {@link
     * MappedByteBuffer#force force} method of the mapped byte buffer will
     * force changes made to the buffer's content to be written.  </p>
     *
     * @param   metaData
     *          If <tt>true</tt> then this method is required to force changes
     *          to both the file's content and metadata to be written to
     *          storage; otherwise, it need only force content changes to be
     *          written
     *
     * @throws  ClosedChannelException
     *          If this channel is closed
     *
     * @throws  IOException
     *          If some other I/O error occurs
     */
    public abstract void force(boolean metaData) throws IOException;


## flush

    flush 是 OutputStream类中的方法

    /**
     * Flushes this output stream and forces any buffered output bytes
     * to be written out. The general contract of <code>flush</code> is
     * that calling it is an indication that, if any bytes previously
     * written have been buffered by the implementation of the output
     * stream, such bytes should immediately be written to their
     * intended destination.
     * <p>
     * If the intended destination of this stream is an abstraction provided by
     * the underlying operating system, for example a file, then flushing the
     * stream guarantees only that bytes previously written to the stream are
     * passed to the operating system for writing; it does not guarantee that
     * they are actually written to a physical device such as a disk drive.
     * <p>
     * The <code>flush</code> method of <code>OutputStream</code> does nothing.
     *
     * @exception  IOException  if an I/O error occurs.
     */
     public void flush() throws IOException {}


## sync

sync是 FileDescriptor类的方法

     /**
     * Force all system buffers to synchronize with the underlying
     * device.  This method returns after all modified data and
     * attributes of this FileDescriptor have been written to the
     * relevant device(s).  In particular, if this FileDescriptor
     * refers to a physical storage medium, such as a file in a file
     * system, sync will not return until all in-memory modified copies
     * of buffers associated with this FileDescriptor have been
     * written to the physical medium.
     *
     * sync is meant to be used by code that requires physical
     * storage (such as a file) to be in a known state  For
     * example, a class that provided a simple transaction facility
     * might use sync to ensure that all changes to a file caused
     * by a given transaction were recorded on a storage medium.
     *
     * sync only affects buffers downstream of this FileDescriptor.  If
     * any in-memory buffering is being done by the application (for
     * example, by a BufferedOutputStream object), those buffers must
     * be flushed into the FileDescriptor (for example, by invoking
     * OutputStream.flush) before that data will be affected by sync.
     *
     * @exception SyncFailedException
     *        Thrown when the buffers cannot be flushed,
     *        or because the system cannot guarantee that all the
     *        buffers have been synchronized with physical media.
     * @since     JDK1.1
     */
    public native void sync() throws SyncFailedException;


flush不能保证写入磁盘或者写入成功。
force会保证写入磁盘成功。
sync之前要调用flush把缓种数据写入。


flush+sync=force。
